\section{Projects}
Map spatial and temporal data
at global, national, state, and city scales.
Make beautiful maps that 
clearly, legibly represent the data,
express your message, and
follow cartographic conventions.
Legends, scale bars, and north arrows are required.
Upload your working files and finished work to the course drive.
Exhibit your collected work at the end of the semester on
\emph{12/2/2019}.\\

\noindent \textbf{Global maps}
Create a map of a global pattern or process. 
Possible topics include landcover change, protected areas,
urbanization, biodiversity, hydrology, transportation, etc.
Choose your map projection carefully.
Cartographic grids or graticules are recommended.
\emph{Draft due: 9/16/2019}\\

\noindent \textbf{National \& state maps}
Create a map of the U.S.A. or Louisiana.
Possible topics include coastal change, urbanization, hydrology, topography, fire,
biodiversity, protected areas, transportation, infrastructure, levees, oil and gas, etc.
\emph{Draft due: 9/23/2019}\\

\noindent \textbf{City maps}
Create a map of New Orleans. 
Possible topics include the built environment, 
cultural events, cultural and historic places, 
socioeconomic conditions, public health, crime, education, 
hydrology, terrain, levees, flooding, etc.
\emph{Draft due: 9/23/2019}\\

\noindent \textbf{Suitability map}
Use map overlay analysis 
to develop a suitability map.
Create a diagram illustrating 
the logic of your analysis.
\emph{Draft due: 11/25/2019}\\

\noindent \textbf{3D printed city}
3D print the city of New Orleans from lidar data. 
As a class use a tiling scheme 
to divide the lidar data into smaller tiles for printing.
Each of you will 3D print a tile and then
as a class you will put your tiles together 
to build a complete model of downtown New Orleans.
Each of you will project a map onto the model.
\emph{Draft due: 10/28/2019}\\

\noindent \textbf{Portfolio}
Collect your work in a course portfolio 
for the school's accreditation archive.
\emph{Due: 12/13/2019}\\

\section{Policies}

\noindent \textbf{Accreditation Expectations}
As an accredited Landscape Architecture program
LSU's Robert Reich School of Landscape Architecture (RRSLA) 
must meet the accreditation requirements 
as stated by the Landscape Architectural Accreditation
Board (LAAB) to ensure RRSLA is meeting the expectations of the field. 
The LAAB requires programs to provide digital copies 
of student work as part of this process.
Students in this course will be expected 
to comply with the following requirements
as 5\% of their course grade: 
(1) Students must provide a course portfolio
with work samples specified by the instructor 
before the end of the grading period. 
(2) Each student's course portfolio must be saved as 
a single, high resolution PDF file with multiple pages. 
(3) Files must follow the naming convention
established by the school: department-coursenumber-semesteryear-username.pdf.
Example: LA4201-F2019-baharmon.pdf.\\

\noindent \textbf{Time Commitment Expectations}
LSU's general policy states that for each credit hour, you (the student) should plan to
spend at least two hours working on course related activities outside of class. Since this course is for three credit hours, you should expect to spend a minimum of six hours outside of class each week working on assignments for this course. For more information see: 
\url{http://catalog.lsu.edu/content.php?catoid=12&navoid=822}.\\

\noindent \textbf{LSU student code of conduct}
The LSU student code of conduct explains student rights, excused absences, and what is expected of student behavior. Students are expected to understand this code:  \url{http://students.lsu.edu/saa/students/code}.\\ %Any violations of the LSU student code will be duly reported to the Dean of Students.\\

\noindent \textbf{Disability Code}
The University is committed to making reasonable efforts to assist individuals with disabilities in
their efforts to avail themselves of services and programs offered by the University. To this end,
Louisiana State University will provide reasonable accommodations for persons with
documented qualifying disabilities. If you have a disability and feel you need accommodations in
this course, you must present a letter to me from Disability Services in 115 Johnston Hall,
indicating the existence of a disability and the suggested accommodations.\\

\noindent \textbf{Academic Integrity}
According to section 10.1 of the LSU Code of Student Conduct, ``A student may be charged with Academic Misconduct'' for a variety of offenses, including the following: unauthorized copying, collusion, or collaboration; ``falsifying'' data or citations; ``assisting someone in the commission or attempted commission of an offense''; and plagiarism, which is defined in section 10.1.H as a ``lack of appropriate citation, or the unacknowledged inclusion of someone else's words, structure, ideas, or data; failure to identify a source, or the submission of essentially the same work for two assignments without permission of the instructor(s).''\\

\noindent \textbf{Plagiarism and Citation Method}
Plagiarism is the ``lack of appropriate citation, or the unacknowledged inclusion of someone else's words, structure, ideas, or data; failure to identify a source, or the submission of essentially the same work for two assignments without permission of the instructor(s)'' (Sec. 10.1.H of the LSU Code of Student Conduct). As a student at LSU, it is your responsibility to refrain from plagiarizing the academic property of another and to utilize appropriate citation method for all coursework. In this class, it is recommended that you use Chicago Style author-date citations. Ignorance of the citation method is not an excuse for academic misconduct.
