\section{Course Description}

This course is an introduction to 
computational design for landscape architects.
In this course you will learn how to 
algorithmically model landscapes,
numerically simulate physical processes 
like the flow of water and sediment,
and digitally fabricate landforms.  
You will conduct surveys with drones and terrestrial lidar,
use point clouds to model and visualize terrain and planting,
parametrically model variations on landscapes
using visual programming, 
and computer numerical control (CNC) mill landforms. 
In this course you will 
learn creative approaches to computational design 
and apply emerging technologies to landscape architecture.

\section{Essays}

\paragraph{Essay: Cloudism}
Read Christophe Girot's essay \emph{Cloudism}
and write a 500-word critical response. 
What potential do you see in point clouds
as a medium for landscape architecture?
What makes point clouds different
from other modes of representation?

\paragraph{Essay: The Alphabet and Algorithm}
Read Mario Carpo's \emph{The Alphabet and Algorithm}
and then in response write a 500-word critical essay.
How have digital tools and processes transformed 
the practice of landscape architecture
and how do you think they will shape 
the future of the discipline?
How do you envision using
digital design tools and processes in your work?

% -------------------------------- Projects --------------------------------

\section{Projects}

\noindent \textbf{Point Cloud Library}
Use laser scanning to capture a library of plants as point clouds. 
Publish the point cloud to the web in an interactive viewer.

\paragraph{Drone Survey}
Conduct a topographic survey 
of the landform at Hilltop Arboretum
with a drone.
Use real-time kinematic GNSS
to establish ground control points. 
Use structure-from-motion photogrammetry 
to generate a point cloud, 
digital surface model, 
and orthophoto.

\paragraph{Parametric Landscape}
Use visual programming to generate
variations of landforms, plantings, and paving.
CNC mill, thermoform, and then cast 
an algorithmically generated terrain model.

\paragraph{Parametric Wall}
Program a robotic arm to assemble 
a parametrically modeled, curvilinear wall
from bricks.

% -------------------------------- Policies --------------------------------

\section{Policies}

\paragraph{Time Commitment Expectations}
LSU's general policy states that for each credit hour, you (the student) should plan to
spend at least two hours working on course related activities outside of class. Since this course is for three credit hours, you should expect to spend a minimum of six hours outside of class each week working on assignments for this course. For more information see: 
\url{http://catalog.lsu.edu/content.php?catoid=12&navoid=822}.

\paragraph{LSU student code of conduct}
The LSU student code of conduct explains student rights, excused absences, and what is expected of student behavior. Students are expected to understand this code:  \url{http://students.lsu.edu/saa/students/code}.

\paragraph{Disability Code}
The University is committed to making reasonable efforts to assist individuals with disabilities in
their efforts to avail themselves of services and programs offered by the University. To this end,
Louisiana State University will provide reasonable accommodations for persons with
documented qualifying disabilities. If you have a disability and feel you need accommodations in
this course, you must present a letter to me from Disability Services in 115 Johnston Hall,
indicating the existence of a disability and the suggested accommodations.

\paragraph{Academic Integrity}
According to section 10.1 of the LSU Code of Student Conduct, ``A student may be charged with Academic Misconduct'' for a variety of offenses, including the following: unauthorized copying, collusion, or collaboration; ``falsifying'' data or citations; ``assisting someone in the commission or attempted commission of an offense''; and plagiarism, which is defined in section 10.1.H as a ``lack of appropriate citation, or the unacknowledged inclusion of someone else's words, structure, ideas, or data; failure to identify a source, or the submission of essentially the same work for two assignments without permission of the instructor(s).''

\paragraph{Plagiarism and Citation Method}
Plagiarism is the ``lack of appropriate citation, or the unacknowledged inclusion of someone else's words, structure, ideas, or data; failure to identify a source, or the submission of essentially the same work for two assignments without permission of the instructor(s)'' (Sec. 10.1.H of the LSU Code of Student Conduct). As a student at LSU, it is your responsibility to refrain from plagiarizing the academic property of another and to utilize appropriate citation method for all coursework. In this class, it is recommended that you use Chicago Style author-date citations. Ignorance of the citation method is not an excuse for academic misconduct.

\paragraph{Accreditation Expectations}
As an accredited Landscape Architecture program
LSU's Robert Reich School of Landscape Architecture (RRSLA) 
must meet the accreditation requirements 
as stated by the Landscape Architectural Accreditation
Board (LAAB) to ensure RRSLA is meeting the expectations of the field. 
The LAAB requires programs to provide digital copies 
of student work as part of this process.
Students in this course will be expected 
to comply with the following requirements
as 5\% of their course grade: 
(1) Students must provide a course portfolio
with work samples specified by the instructor 
before the end of the grading period. 
(2) Each student's course portfolio must be saved as 
a single, high resolution PDF file with multiple pages. 
(3) Files must follow the naming convention
established by the school: department-coursenumber-semesteryear-username.pdf.
Example: LA7032-S2023 -baharmon.pdf.
